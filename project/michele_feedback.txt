I am glad you were able to figure out how to get the alarm clock working! It makes the most awful noise - it will definitely wake me up. I also like that you incorporated shaking the phone to snooze it. My main feedback is not about the app technically - as far as I can tell, it works great to set the alarm, stop the alarm, and snooze it. It also lets me set another alarm and works great after that. The thing I would improve the most is the interface. When I see the textbox to type in a time, I want to know how I should format the time. Do I write with spaces? Do I need a :? The easy way to fix this is to write below it in a label “Write your time like this: HH:MM” or something like that. The second thing is that I don’t even know that the cool thing about the alarm clock is that the snooze is set with shaking - the label that appears only when the alarm clock goes off should probably be displayed not only when the alarm goes off. In general, great job with the app!
